Have Django installed. Run `python manage.py runserver`

FLAW 1:
settings.py PASSWORD_HASHERS
The website stores users' passwords without hashing them, in plain text. This is mentioned in the OWASP Top 10 under "AO2:2021 - Cryptographic failures". In the event of a database leak, all the users' passwords are compromised. This allows for attacks on other services they might be using the same password on.
This can be fixed by removing the variable PASSWORD_HASHERS from settings.py, and removing the hash.py file altogether. Most modern frameworks, like Django, hash passwords by default. In this case it required effort to implement this flaw.
